Yes, your approach is **absolutely workable** and aligns well with the principles of **incremental scheduling**. By focusing only on future flights and minimizing disruptions to the existing schedule, you can efficiently handle real-time changes while maintaining operational continuity. Let’s break down your thoughts and validate them:

---

### 1. **Generate the Initial Schedule for the Whole Day on D-1**
   - This is a standard practice. The initial schedule serves as a baseline for the day’s operations.
   - It includes all flights, services, and staff assignments for the entire day.

---

### 2. **Focus Only on Future Flights When Changes Occur**
   - **Why this makes sense**:
     - Past flights have already been executed, and their assignments are no longer relevant.
     - By reducing the problem space to only future flights, you significantly reduce the computational complexity of rescheduling.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Filter out past flights from the list of flights before creating the new model.
     - Only include flights that are yet to be executed.

---

### 3. **Reduce the Problem Space by Removing Past Flights**
   - This is a key optimization. By excluding past flights, you:
     - Reduce the number of variables and constraints in the model.
     - Focus computational resources on solving the most relevant part of the problem (future flights).

---

### 4. **Create a New Version of the Schedule/Assignments**
   - **Why this is necessary**:
     - Changes (e.g., delays, staff unavailability) may invalidate parts of the existing schedule.
     - A new version of the schedule ensures that the updated constraints and objectives are properly reflected.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Create a new `assignments` dictionary for future flights, services, and staff.
     - Reuse valid assignments from the previous schedule as hints.

---

### 5. **Add Hints from the Previous Schedule**
   - **Why this is important**:
     - Hints guide the solver to prefer assignments from the previous schedule that are still valid.
     - This minimizes disruptions and ensures continuity in operations.
   - **Implementation**:
     - For each valid assignment in the previous schedule, add a hint to the corresponding variable in the new model.

---

### 6. **Run the Solver to Find the New Schedule**
   - The solver will:
     - Respect the hints for valid assignments.
     - Find new assignments for disrupted or new components.
     - Ensure that all constraints (e.g., certifications, availability) are satisfied.

---

### Why Your Approach Works

1. **Efficiency**:
   - By focusing only on future flights, you reduce the problem size, making the solver faster and more responsive to changes.

2. **Minimized Disruptions**:
   - Reusing valid assignments as hints ensures that the new schedule is as close as possible to the previous one, minimizing operational disruptions.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - The approach can handle a wide range of changes, including delays, cancellations, staff unavailability, and new flights.

4. **Scalability**:
   - The incremental nature of the approach makes it scalable for large schedules with frequent changes.

### Implementation Steps

Here’s how you can implement your approach:

#### Step 1: Filter Out Past Flights
```python
from datetime import datetime

def filter_future_flights(flights: List[Flight], current_time: datetime) -> List[Flight]:
    """Filter out past flights and return only future flights."""
    return [flight for flight in flights if flight.departure > current_time]
```

#### Step 2: Create a New Version of Assignments
```python
def create_new_assignments(self, future_flights: List[Flight]):
    """Create a new assignments dictionary for future flights."""
    new_assignments = {}
    for flight in future_flights:
        for flight_service in flight.flight_services:
            for staff in self.roster:
                key = (flight.number, flight_service.id, staff.id)
                if key in self.assignments:
                    # Reuse the existing variable
                    new_assignments[key] = self.assignments[key]
                else:
                    # Create a new variable
                    new_assignments[key] = self.model.NewBoolVar(f"assigned_{key}")
    return new_assignments
```

#### Step 3: Add Hints from the Previous Schedule
```python
def add_hints_from_previous_schedule(self, new_assignments: dict):
    """Add hints for valid assignments from the previous schedule."""
    for key, var in new_assignments.items():
        if key in self.assignments and self.solver.Value(self.assignments[key]):
            # If the assignment was True in the previous schedule, hint it to be True
            self.solver.AddHint(var, 1)
        else:
            # Otherwise, hint it to be False
            self.solver.AddHint(var, 0)
```

#### Step 4: Handle Updates
```python
def handle_update(self, current_time: datetime, invalid_flights: set, invalid_services: set, invalid_staff: set):
    """Handle updates by creating a new schedule for future flights."""
    # Step 1: Filter out past flights
    future_flights = filter_future_flights(self.flights, current_time)

    # Step 2: Create new assignments for future flights
    new_assignments = self.create_new_assignments(future_flights)

    # Step 3: Reset invalid assignments
    self.reset_invalid_assignments(invalid_flights, invalid_services, invalid_staff)

    # Step 4: Add hints from the previous schedule
    self.add_hints_from_previous_schedule(new_assignments)

    # Step 5: Rerun the solver
    status = self.solver.Solve(self.model)
    if status == cp_model.OPTIMAL or status == cp_model.FEASIBLE:
        logging.info("Schedule updated successfully!")
        self.current_schedule = self.generate_schedule()
    else:
        logging.warning("No feasible solution found after update.")
```

---

### Example Usage

```python
# Current time
current_time = datetime.now()

# Example changes
invalid_flights = {"F123"}  # Flight F123 is canceled
invalid_services = {"SRV789"}  # Service SRV789 is removed
invalid_staff = {"S456"}  # Staff S456 is unavailable

# Handle updates
scheduler.handle_update(current_time, invalid_flights, invalid_services, invalid_staff)
```

### Conclusion

Your approach is **workable and efficient**. By focusing on future flights, reusing valid assignments, and minimizing disruptions, you can handle real-time changes effectively. This incremental scheduling strategy ensures that the system remains responsive and scalable, even in dynamic environments.
